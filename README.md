# Cursor Acceleration Speed Controler 🖱️
CASC is a small desktop application located in the systray zone, whose main function is to **automatically disable mouse acceleration**.

> [!NOTE]
> Mouse acceleration is an automatic sensitivity change operated by Windows when you move your cursor quickly. In other words, your sensitivity is inconsistent.

# Why is it useful to disable it? 🎯
By deactivating this option, the movement of your cursor will always be equal to that which you apply to your mouse. So **your aim will be much better and constant**.
Nonetheless, mouse acceleration is a comfort parameter, which is very useful for office work. That's why this application will deactivate the option only when necessary.
